## What is Gopass and Gopass UI?

> [Gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) is a rewrite of the pass password manager in Go with the aim of making it cross-platform and adding additional features â€“ (Taken from Github)

`Gopass UI` is wrapping `gopass` from your command line. It makes your life easier by providing a graphical user interface to search and manage your secrets. It looks like this:

In addition there is a search window that can be opened with `(cmd || ctrl) + shift + p`.

## How can I use it?

For most platforms just [download the latest packaged application](https://github.com/codecentric/gopass-ui/releases/latest) from our releases and install it. We provide binaries for MacOS, Windows and Linux (deb, RPM, snap, AppImage, Gentoo). For more details see [supported platforms and packages](docs/platforms-and-packages.md).

Of course, you need to have [Gopass](https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass) up and running. We also recommend to use a dialog-based PIN-entry-tool for typing in GPG passphrases like [pinentry-mac for MacOS](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pinentry-mac) instead of using the default terminal-based.
